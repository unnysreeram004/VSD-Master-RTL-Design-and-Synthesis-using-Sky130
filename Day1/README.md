Goal: To setup the working environment for the upcoming labs. 

STEPS
1. Cloned the repository from https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
2. Install iVerilog, gtkwave, Yosys. I used "-V" with both these tools to verify if they are installed correctly.

Notes
* verilog_files/ contains all the design HDLs along with the respective test-benches. This is the primary working directory for all the labs in this course. 
* lib/ contains the liberty models of the std. cells. 
* my_lib/ contains the verilog models of the std. cells.
